  The license of IrrPhysx is based on the zlib/libpng license.
  Even though this license does not require you to mention that you are
  using IrrPhysx in your product, an acknowledgement would be highly appreciated.

  You should note that using IrrPhysx means you must also follow the restrictions
  and requirements of the Physx licences. These can be found at this link:

    http://developer.nvidia.com/object/physx_EULA.html

  Please note that IrrPhysx is based in part on the work of the Independent
  JPEG Group, the zlib, and libpng (through the use of the Irrlicht Engine).
  This means that if you use IrrPhysx in your product, you must acknowledge
  somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code and libpng.
  It would also be nice to mention that you use IrrPhysx and the zlib.
  See the README files in the jpeglib and the zlib directories of the
  Irrlicht Engine for further informations.
